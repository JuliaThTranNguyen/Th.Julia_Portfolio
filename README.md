## [LIVE DEMO](https://th-julia-portfolio.vercel.app/)

## IDE I use for coding :bulb:
- VsCode

## Distribution : :bulb:
- Linux OS

## Relevant Technologies:
### [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) 
- React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web and mobile applications. React uses a component-based architecture, where UIs are divided into reusable components. These components manage their own state and can be composed to build complex UIs. React applications are typically faster and more efficient due to its virtual DOM, which minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM, leading to improved performance and better user experience.

### [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) 
- Vite is a build tool for front-end web development. It aims to make the process of building modern web applications faster and more efficient. Vite focuses on providing a highly optimized development server that offers near-instantaneous cold server start, along with lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR). Vite supports various front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Preact. It leverages ES modules for faster development and offers an intuitive and easy-to-use configuration system. Vite's development server and build tools are designed to enhance the developer experience, making it a popular choice among modern web developers.

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs)
- Vercel is a cloud platform that focuses on providing seamless and efficient deployment and hosting solutions for modern web applications. It is particularly popular for hosting frontend applications and static websites. Vercel supports a variety of front-end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, and more. Developers can easily deploy their projects from Git repositories, enabling automatic deployments upon code changes. Vercel offers features like serverless functions, custom domains, and SSL certificates, making it a convenient choice for developers looking to deploy their applications quickly and easily. Vercel's intuitive interface and integration with popular version control systems make it a popular choice among developers for hosting and deploying web applications.
